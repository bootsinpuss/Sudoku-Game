#Sudoku Game

##Intro
This game project is to demonstrate the **modular Javascript architecture** with build and test system.

Due to the demonstration purpose, you will see some inconsistency in the implementation because I want to show as much techniques as possible, and some techniques may be overkill for this simple game.

##How to run
1. Clone this project

   `git clone git@github.com:bootsinpuss/Sudoku-Game.git`

2. Install all components

   `bower install` and `sudo npm install`
   
3. Install compass

   `gem install compass`
   
4. Use grunt to run

   `grunt`
   
5. If you have Google Chrome, the web page will open for you automatically. Enjoy!

##Grunt tasks
`grunt test` will run all unit tests and coverage report will be opened in the browser after all tests passed

`grunt lint` will run jshint to source code

`grunt build` will build all js and scss files using Browserify and Compass respectively

##Game Feature
1. Select difficutly between ***easy***, ***medium*** and ***hard***
2. Retry current game any time
3. Get another new game anytime
4. Show solution any time
5. Dial panel style number picker with only valid numbers

##External Library List
### Development
1. **jQuey** for DOM manipulating
2. **Scss** for styling
2. **Browserify** for using CommonJs `require` in client side
3. **Bower** for installing and managing libraries
4. **Grunt** for watch and build system
5. **Jshint** for code lint

## Test
1. **Moch** as test framework
2. **Chai** for assertion
3. **Sinon** for spy and stub
4. **Rewire** for mocking dependencies

##Directory Structure
The directory structure is very straighforward:

```
root/
  app/						
  	libs/ 					(external library)
    scripts/ 				(js code)
    styles/ 				(scss code)
  build/
  	scripts/				(source code generated by browserify)
  	styles/					(css code generated by compass)
  test/
  	unit/					(test code for unit test)
  test-coverage/
  	blanket.js				(coverage config)
  	coverage.html			(coverage report)
  .bowerrc					(bower config file)
  .editorconfig				(code style config file)
  .gitignore				(git ignore)
  bower.json				(bower component list file)
  Gruntfile.js				(Grunt config file)
  index.html				(entry point for game)
  jshintrc.json				(jshint config)
  package.json				(npm config)
  
```

##Technology Feature
1. Use Objected-Oriented and Modular way to write JavaScript

  * cell.js - use prototype to implement class
   
  * game.js - use closure to implement private member variable, is a singleton

  * numberSelector.js - use prototype to implement class, is a singleton

  * model.js - modular way to encapsulate all data related code

  * layoutHelper - modular way to group helper functions

2. Use Scss for cleaner CSS

  * main.scss - import all components here for better management
  * global.scss - global scss variables

3. Use responsive design for mobile-friendly UI

4. Taking test into consideration when writing code

  * Put all util functions into `utils` object and expose it to ease stub in unit test
  * Most functions will have dependencies passed in as parameters to ease *dependency injection* in unit test
  * Cover more than **90%** lines of code for most module except those with many DOM manipulation

##If had more time
1. Improve UI and add more fancy animations
2. Clean up code and try to achieve 100% unit test coverage
3. Add functional test
4. Bug fixes
